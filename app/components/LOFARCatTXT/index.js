            The goal of this use case is to simplify the processing of archived data. Astronomers should be able to select a dataset on a portal, select a workflow, and then launch the processing pipeline from there. For this we need an easy to use, flexible, efficient and scalable workflow infrastructure for processing of extremely large volumes of astronomical observation data.
          </p>
          <p>
              Through this portal, the astronomer must be able to browse through the available datasets and available workflows, and launch processing directly from there to the hardware infrastructure available in the project. Data should then be transferred from the LTA to the processing infrastructure, processed, and the results made available in the portal.
